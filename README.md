This project uses data detailing the physical properties of a sample of dry beans coming from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The goal of the project was to use clustering (an unsupervised machine learning algorithm) to reduce the cardinality of kinds of dry beans (beginning with 7) into similar clusters. In the hypothetical a manufacturing plant is aiming to reduce complexity of their business processes by using the same manufacturing technique for multiple different kinds of beans.

Following data visualization, exploration, and modeling I disocvered that the 7 kinds of dry beans could be logically grouped into 4 larger clusters of similar characteristics. For the factory in question, this would reduce complexity by only requiring the adoption of 4 processes and in turn save money.
